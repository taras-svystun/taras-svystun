### What's up :fist_right: :fist_left:

## My name is Taras Svystun.

I am passionate about applying math to solve challenging real-world problems and investigating emerging technologies. Currently, I am on my third year at Ukrainian Catholic University. Statistics, calculus and linear algebra fascinate me! Python is my second native language after Ukrainian. I have confidence when it comes to data cleaning + statistical inference analysis. I am also a big fan of meaningful and interactive visualizations. I am used to reading scientific papers + I often read some books on related topics. So far, I have experience with more than 15 datasets from Kaggle. I was also very committed to my data science-related study projects, often going beyond what was in the task statement. My friends usually describe me as a person with strong analytical skills, detail-oriented, proactive, and able to work in a dynamic environment. I have experience working with complex datasets, building models, and distilling insights for management. I enjoy working in collaborative teams and have excellent interpersonal skills. As a Data Scientist, I am not afraid to take responsibility to lead anything which is required and always see a path forward to success. I don't blame, I ask questions. I thrive in ambiguity and am passionate about creating new products with meaningful and disruptive impact to the world.
